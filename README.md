## Prerequisites 💻
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v18.x)
npm (v10.x)

## Setting Up the Application Locally 🔧
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nasa-explorer.git
cd nasa-explorer
2. Install Dependencies
First, install the necessary dependencies for both frontend and backend.

bash
Copy
# Install dependencies for the entire project
npm install
3. Run the Application Locally 🚀
Backend
In the backend directory, run:

bash
Copy
cd backend
npm install
npm start
This starts the backend server.

Frontend
In a separate terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and run:

bash
Copy
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
This starts the frontend development server.

# The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000 and the backend at http://localhost:5000 (or another port if configured).

## Testing the Application 🧪
Once both servers are running locally, open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the application.
